  <h1>DOE Security Force</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Department of Energy Security Force (DOE SF)</strong> is one of the primary security organizations within the Black Mesa Research Facility.
    Operating under the U.S. Department of Energy, this unit is tasked with securing high-risk research zones and ensuring containment of experimental threats.
  </p>

  <h2>Primary Roles</h2>
  <p>
    • Guarding top-secret research sectors and controlling access<br>
    • Securing hazardous material zones<br>
    • First-response operations during anomalies and emergencies<br>
    • Executive protection for VIPs and senior personnel<br>
    • Coordinated missions with other Black Mesa security teams
  </p>

  <h2>Equipment & Tactical Capability</h2>
  <p>
    DOE Security personnel are equipped with advanced gear, including tactical armor, night-vision systems, biometric monitoring (ELM), and encrypted communications.
    Many operations are jointly conducted with the Black Mesa Special Security Force (SSF) and the First Response Tactical Operations Unit (FRTOU).
  </p>

  <h2>Training & Veteran Status</h2>
  <p>
    Recruits are typically drawn from military or high-security backgrounds and undergo continuous high-intensity tactical training.<br>
    Veterans who serve in DOE Security for extended periods may transition to the Black Mesa Security Division (BMSD),
    often earning distinction with unique collar pins that signify their service years.
  </p>

  <h2>Secrecy & External Operations</h2>
  <p>
    All DOE Security activities are strictly classified. When operating beyond the facility,
    agents may be disguised as "DOE Technical Inspection Teams" or "Energy Safety Delegates" for covert assignments.
